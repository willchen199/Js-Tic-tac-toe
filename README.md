# Overview

{I am trying to make a tic tac toe game in java sprit}

{Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game is a simple example of games we can program in JavaScript. Game making is the most popular branch of programming. It is also an amazing way to learn the basics of a programming language while creating a simple and interesting project. In this project I will learn how to a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Starting with the HTML code, which is the part for assigning id tags and classes to the elements of our game, such as the board and cells. The longest part of making the Tic-Tac-Toe game is the JavaScript code, which makes the game interactive. Lastly, I will show how to personalize the game using CSS.}

{I wrote this game becasue I like games and its the best way to learn a programe.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
